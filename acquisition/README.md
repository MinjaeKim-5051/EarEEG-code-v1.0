## Signal acquisition code

This repository contains the FPGA and host-side source code used for signal data acquisition for IC electrical evaluation.
The code is provided for transparency and documentation of the acquisition system evaluation. It is not intended to function as a standalone or fully executable package.
Reproducing the system requires specific hardware, vendor software (Xilinx Vivado, Opal Kelly FrontPanel), and device configuration files, which are not included.
The source code allows inspection of the system architecture, timing, and data flow implemented in the reported experiments.
