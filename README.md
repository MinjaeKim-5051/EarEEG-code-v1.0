# EarEEG-code-v1.0
This repository contains the firmware, acquisition, and analysis code associated with the manuscript "Chip-in-ear wireless embedded platform for capacitive neural monitoring", submitted to Nature Sensors.

## Overview and usage note
The code provided here documents the implementation used in the study and is shared for transparency and reference. 
Minor configuration may be required depending on the specific experimental protocol and data format.
Due to hardware-specific dependencies, licensing restrictions, and limitations on sharing human-subject data, this repository is provided for transparency and reference rather than as a standalone, fully reproducible software package.

## Repository structure
- `firmware/` — Embedded firmware code used in the developed system
- `acquisition_analysis/` — Data acquisition and analysis script
