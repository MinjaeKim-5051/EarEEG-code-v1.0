This repository contains the author-developed source code for BLE-based wireless data acquisition used in the proposed system.

The code implements routines for receiving streamed data packets over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), including device pairing, timestamp handling, and data logging. The implementation is intended to support wireless transmission of physiological and test signals. No external firmware or proprietary middleware is redistributed here. The BLE acquisition code is designed to operate with the corresponding hardware device. Minor configuration may be required depending on the specific experimental protocol and data format.

The code is provided for transparency and documentation of the wireless data acquisition methodology used in the study.
