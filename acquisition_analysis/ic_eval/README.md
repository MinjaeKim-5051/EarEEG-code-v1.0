This repository contains the author-developed source code used for evaluation and characterization of the integrated circuit (IC) described in the proposed system.

The code implements routines for configuring the test setup, reading measurement data, and processing results. Typical use cases include noise analysis and signal readout evaluation. The implementation is intended to support repeatable testing with the corresponding hardware. No external firmware or proprietary middleware is redistributed here. The code is not intended to function as a standalone analysis package without the corresponding measurement setup and input data. Example measurement data are not included in this repository, and the datasets may be made available upon reasonable request. Minor configuration may be required depending on the specific experimental protocol and data format.

The code is provided for transparency and documentation of the IC electrical test methodology used in the study.
