This repository provides a patch file capturing the application-level modifications made to a vendor-provided NXP BLE example used in the proposed system.

The firmware implementation is primarily based on the NXP example project `qn908xcdk_wireless_examples_bluetooth_private_profile_server_bm`, and also references components and implementation patterns from `qn908xcdk_driver_examples_i2c_dma_transfer`. Only the modifications introduced by the authors are provided here in the form of a unified patch file. The original example project, SDK sources, BLE protocol stack implementations, board support package, and toolchain files are not redistributed in this repository. This repository is made publicly available for transparency and documentation purposes only. It is not intended to function as a standalone or fully executable firmware package. Reproducing the system requires the corresponding NXP hardware, the appropriate MCUXpresso SDK (including the BLE stack), and the vendor development environment (e.g., MCUXpresso IDE), which must be obtained directly from NXP. The patch file primarily modifies the application-layer logic in `private_profile_server.c`, where the system-specific data handling, packet formatting, and timing behavior used in the proposed system are implemented. Vendor-owned source files are not included in this repository due to hardware dependency and licensing restrictions.

The provided patch is sufficient to allow inspection of the firmware architecture, data flow, and timing logic relevant to the reported system operations.
