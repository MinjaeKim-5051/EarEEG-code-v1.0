This repository contains the FPGA and host-side source code used for signal data acquisition for IC evaluation. 

The code is provided for transparency and documentation of the proposed system. It is not intended to function as a standalone or fully executable package. Reproducing the system requires specific hardware, vendor software (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Opal Kelly FrontPanel), and device configuration files, which are not included due to hardware dependency and licensing restrictions.

The source code allows inspection of the system architecture, timing, and data flow implemented in the reported experiments.
